<h1 align=center>Pseudo Code</h1>

```
1.	START

2.	INPUT  y 

3.	IF y<=0, THEN 
        PRINT “Invalid Output”
        
4.	ELSE IF y%2==0 THEN
        PRINT “It is an even number”

5.	ELSE 
        PRINT “It is an odd number”

6.	END IF

7.	END


```
<h1 align=center>Approach</h1>
The problem was to check if a number is even or odd with restrictions of it being greater than zero. If the number is positive and is divisible by 2 then it is an even number otherwise it is an odd number
