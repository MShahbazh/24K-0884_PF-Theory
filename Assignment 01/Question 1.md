```
1.	START

2.	INPUT 
        Input kms 

3.	PROCESS
        mph=kms*2250

4.	OUTPUT
        output mph 

5.	END



```

<h1 align=center>Approach</h1>
The problem was to convert kilometers per second to miles per hour. Therefore, to solve this we need to find relation between mph and kms. 

1mile= 1.609km 

1hr=3600sec

From this we can derive the formula, 
mph=kms*2237.40
