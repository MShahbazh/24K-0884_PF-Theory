<h1 align=center>Pseudo Code</h1>

```
1.	START

2.	INPUT age, Ride, height

3.	IF Ride= Dragon Roller Coaster 
                IF age >=10 AND height>=48 
                    PRINT “You meet the requirements for the Dragon Roller Coaster”
                ELSE 
                    PRINT “Sorry, you do not meet the requirements for the Dragon Roller Coaster”
                END IF 

4.	ELSE IF Ride==Sky Swing 
                IF height>=54 
                    PRINT “You meet the requirements for Sky Swing”
                ELSE 
                    PRINT “Sorry, you do not meet the requirements for Sky Swing”
                END IF 

5.	ELSE IF Ride==Carousel 
                IF age >=5 
                    PRINT “You meet the requirements for Carousel”
                ELSE 
                    PRINT “Sorry, you do not meet the requirements for Carousel”
                END IF 

6.	ELSE 
                PRINT “No such ride exists” 

7.	END IF 

8.	END

<h1 align=center>Approach</h1>

The height and age requirements for the rides are different therefore different decision boxes will be made for different rides. For the Roller Coaster, height and age both are required therefore I used AND condition between them
