I used the strtok and strcmp string.h functions and Calculated the Number of letters using another array to store thir occurences in thier ASCII codes as index numbers. 
Though this problem could also be solved using 2d String array but to make it shorter i used the strtok function. I have learned string manipulation and the use of the string functions through this Problem.
