This Problem used a series of for loops.
This was one of te hardest pattern printing problems i have solved. The key to this lies in the dividing the problem in the small parts which i ignored at first. I have learned from this problem that one of the mst important strateg in problem solving is to dicide the problem in smaller problems which will make the problem easier to understand.
